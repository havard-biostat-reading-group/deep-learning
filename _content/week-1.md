Dear All

I have attached reading list for next week. The focus will be to understand the chronological development on the understanding of the expressive power of deep neural nets. 

We do not meet this week since a few might be traveling for the spring break.

* [Hornik (1989) Multilayer Feedforward Networks are Universal Approximators](https://havard-biostat-reading-group.github.io/deep-learning/files/papers/week1/hornik.pdf)
* [Barron (1989) Universal approximation bounds for superpositions of a sigmoidal function](https://havard-biostat-reading-group.github.io/deep-learning/files/papers/week1/barron.pdf)
* [Yarotsky (2017) Error bounds for approximations with deep ReLU networks](https://havard-biostat-reading-group.github.io/deep-learning/files/papers/week1/barron.pdf)
