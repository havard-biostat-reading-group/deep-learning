Week 1: Universal Approximation Theorem

2019-03-26

Readings for March 26, 2019

I have attached reading list for next week. The focus will be to
understand the chronological development on the understanding of the
expressive power of deep neural nets.

We do not meet this week since a few might be traveling for the spring
break.
